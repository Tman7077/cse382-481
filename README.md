# Plan

Help me build the architecture necessary to create, with a team, a product that can track information for cattle which would include:

- A system that has as data input, everything from types of feed to location, to weight gained, to vaccinations given. This system also needs to be able to track the productivity and weight gained since the cattle has entered a feedlot.
- The system also needs to be able to track the cost of feed and where that feed has come from. This is to be used with how long cattle have been on feed to determine the cost needed for the cattle.
- We also need to be able to compare single cows in the lot with other cows, lots with other lots, as well as our feedlot with other feedlots in the local area as well as the world.
- This system needs to be highly concurrent and distributed to avoid single points of failure. The system must scale to support millions of feedlots of all sizes around the world.

## Minimal Viable Product “First Sprint”

- Identify data to track cattle.
- Create a database that mirrors the data to track.
- Be able to manipulate said data.

### Data to Track

- Amount of feed
- Heads of cattle in a pen
- Weight of cattle (to start and ongoing)
- Vaccinations
- Location
- Number of days at the feedlot

## Roadmap

Here's a roadmap for your cattle tracking system project, breaking down tasks into phases to ensure a structured and achievable approach. Each phase includes clear objectives and milestones.

### Phase 1: Planning and Requirements (Week 1-2)

**Goals:**

- Define the scope of the project.
- Determine technical stack and tools.
- Identify key features and user needs.

**Steps:**

1. Define Requirements:
   - Data to track: feed types, locations, weight, vaccinations, productivity, cost.
   - Comparison features: individual cows, lots, and global stats.
   - Scalability and concurrency requirements.
2. Choose a Tech Stack:
   - Backend: Elixir (for scalability and concurrency).
   - Database: PostgreSQL (structured data) or MongoDB (flexible JSON documents).
   - Frontend: React, Vue, or simple HTML/CSS/JS initially.
3. Design Data Models:
   - Define entities: Cattle, Feed, Vaccination, Feedlot, etc.
   - Example:
     ```elixir
     %Cattle{
       id: "cow123",
       weight: 450,
       vaccinations: ["vaccineA", "vaccineB"],
       feed_history: [%{feed: "corn", cost: 5.0, date: "2025-01-01"}]
     }
     ```
4. Set Up a Project Repository:
   - Initialize version control (e.g., GitHub or GitLab).
   - Document goals and setup in a README file.

### Phase 2: Prototype Development (Week 3-4)

**Goals:**

- Create a basic backend with Elixir and Ecto (or MongoDB).
- Design minimal UI for data entry and visualization.

**Steps:**

1. Set Up Backend:
   - Create an Elixir project using `mix new`.
   - Add database integration (e.g., PostgreSQL or MongoDB).
   - Create RESTful APIs for basic operations:
     - Add a cow.
     - Update weight.
     - Add feed or vaccination data.
2. Set Up Frontend:
   - Basic HTML/JS interface or use a React-based framework.
   - Create forms for data input (e.g., adding cows, recording feed).
3. Deploy a Prototype:
   - Use a free tier on Fly.io, Render, or Heroku for deployment.
   - Share the prototype with stakeholders for feedback.

### Phase 3: Core Feature Implementation (Week 5-8)

**Goals:**

- Build and refine core functionality for tracking and comparisons.
- Implement robust error handling and data validation.

**Steps:**

1. Enhance Backend:
   - Add APIs for:
     - Weight tracking over time.
     - Cost analysis of feed and vaccinations.
     - Comparing cows/lots/feedlots.
   - Implement authentication and basic role-based access control.
2. Improve Frontend:
   - Add tables and charts for data visualization (e.g., weight trends, cost breakdowns).
   - Use libraries like Chart.js or D3.js for graphical representations.
3. Testing:
   - Write unit tests for backend and integration tests for APIs.
   - Use tools like ExUnit for Elixir testing and Postman for API testing.

### Phase 4: Scalability and Performance (Week 9-12)

**Goals:**

- Prepare the system for handling millions of records.
- Add concurrency and distributed features.

**Steps:**

1. Optimize Backend:
   - Use Elixir’s GenServer for concurrent processes (e.g., tracking feed costs in real-time).
   - Partition data by regions to improve performance (e.g., separate databases for each country).
2. Add Caching:
   - Use ETS (Erlang Term Storage) for frequently accessed data (e.g., average weight per lot).
3. Distributed Setup:
   - Use clustering (e.g., with Phoenix PubSub or libcluster) for distributed operations.
4. Load Testing:
   - Simulate high loads using tools like Apache JMeter or k6 to ensure the system scales.

### Phase 5: Advanced Features (Week 13-16)

**Goals:**

- Add advanced analytics and integrations.
- Provide global comparison features.

**Steps:**

1. Analytics:
   - Add predictive analysis (e.g., forecasting feed costs or weight gain).
   - Use libraries like Python’s Pandas/NumPy or integrate with a data pipeline tool.
2. Global Comparisons:
   - Integrate with external APIs (e.g., global cattle market data or weather data).
   - Enable cross-feedlot comparisons using aggregated data.
3. User Features:
   - Notifications (e.g., vaccination reminders).
   - Export reports (CSV, PDF).

### Phase 6: Deployment and Maintenance (Week 17-20)

**Goals:**

- Deploy the system to production.
- Ensure stability and reliability.

**Steps:**

1. Production Deployment:
   - Use a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, GCP, or Azure).
   - Set up CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions).
2. Monitoring and Logging:
   - Add tools like Grafana or Prometheus for monitoring.
   - Use structured logging (e.g., with Logflare or Loki).
3. Feedback Loop:
   - Gather user feedback and prioritize feature requests.
   - Fix bugs and improve usability.

### Phase 7: Scale and Iterate (Ongoing)

**Goals:**

- Continuously improve based on real-world usage.
- Expand features for new markets.
